# Week 03 Report — Machine Learning for Smart and Connected Systems (ML4SCS)

## Weekly Goal
Set up preprocessing and training pipeline, and test it with real sensor data from a smartphone.

## Work Done This Week

### 1. Data Work
Switched from Apple Watch to smartphone (via Phyphox app) as the primary data source.
Recorded first real sensor data using Phyphox, with both Accelerometer and Gyroscope simultaneously exported as CSV.
Data structure: `seconds_elapsed, x, y, z` for both sensors.
Currently only digit "3" recorded (10 dummy runs already in place from last week).

### 2. Analysis / Modeling Work
Implemented and tested full preprocessing pipeline in `preprocessing.py`:
- Loads Accelerometer and Gyroscope CSVs from each run folder
- Extracts 24 statistical features per recording (mean, std, max, min for each axis of both sensors)
- Returns feature matrix `(n_samples, 24)` and label array

Implemented `train.py` with a Random Forest Classifier:
- Cross-validation (cv=3) on current data
- Achieved 100% accuracy on single-class data (digit 3 only, as expected)
- Pipeline ready for multi-class training once more digits are recorded

Visualised real Gyroscope data in `accelerometer.py`, which confirmed a clean signal with clear motion pattern visible between seconds 1–5.

### 3. Repository / Documentation Work
Scripts pushed to GitHub:
- `preprocessing.py`: feature extraction pipeline
- `train.py`: model training with Random Forest
- `accelerometer.py`: sensor data visualisation

## Experiments Conducted

| Experiment | Change Made | Result | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Real data recording | Used Phyphox instead of Apple Watch | Clean CSV export with acc + gyro | Smartphone is a viable alternative |
| Preprocessing pipeline | Ran on 10 digit_3 recordings | Feature matrix (10, 24) generated | Pipeline works correctly on real data |
| Random Forest training | Trained on digit_3 only | 100% cross-val accuracy | Expected for single class, needs more digits |

## Results
Full pipeline from raw sensor data to trained model is working end-to-end on real smartphone data.

## Challenges
- Apple Watch still not available, continuing with smartphone via Phyphox
- Only digit "3" recorded so far, so multi-class training not yet possible
- Data collection for digits 0, 1, 2 still pending

## Key Insights
- Phyphox exports clean, well-structured CSVs that are easy to work with
- Feature extraction with statistical measures (mean, std, max, min) works well as a baseline
- Pipeline is modular and ready to scale to more digits

## Plan for Next Week
- Record 10 runs each for digits 0, 1, 2 using Phyphox
- Retrain model on all 4 classes (0–3)
- Evaluate real multi-class accuracy with cross-validation
- Start thinking about feature engineering improvements
